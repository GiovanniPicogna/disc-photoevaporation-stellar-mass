# disc-photoevaporation-stellar-mass

The strong X-ray irradiation from young solar-type stars may play a crucial role in the thermodynamics and chemistry of circumstellar discs, 
driving their evolution in the last stages of disc dispersal as well as shaping the atmospheres of newborn planets.
In this paper we study the influence of stellar mass on mass-loss rates due to X-ray irradiation, extending our previous study on the X-ray luminosity and 
spectrum dependence. 
We focus on masses between 0.1 and 1 solar mass stars, which are the main target of current and future missions to find potentially habitable planets.
We found a linear relationship between the mass-loss rates and the stellar masses when changing the X-ray luminosity accordingly to the stellar mass based on 
observational relationships.
This linear increase is observed also when the X-ray luminosity is kept fixed because of the lower disc aspect ratio which allows the X-ray irradiation to reach
larger radii.
We provide new analytical relations for the mass-loss rates and profiles of photoevaporative winds as a function of the stellar mass that can be used in disc 
and planet population synthesis models.
Our photoevaporative models correctly predict the observed trend of disc life-time as a function of stellar mass that show an increased steepness for stars smaller
than 0.3 Solar mass stars, indicating that X-ray photoevaporation is a good candidate to explain the observed disc lifetimes.
