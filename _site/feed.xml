In this paper we study the influence of stellar mass on mass-loss rates due to X-ray irradiation, extending our previous study of the mass-loss rate’s dependence on the X-ray luminosity and spectrum hardness. We focus on stars with masses between $0.1$ and $1 M_\odot$, which are the main target of current and future missions to find potentially habitable planets.
We find a linear relationship between the mass-loss rates and the stellar masses when changing the X-ray luminosity accordingly with the stellar mass.
This linear increase is observed also when the X-ray luminosity is kept fixed because of the lower disc aspect ratio which allows the X-ray irradiation to reach larger radii.
We provide new analytical relations for the mass-loss rates and profiles of photoevaporative winds as a function of the stellar mass that can be used in disc and planet population synthesis models.
Our photoevaporative models correctly predict the observed trend of disc lifetime as a function of stellar mass with an increased steepness for stars smaller than $0.3 M_\odot$, indicating that X-ray photoevaporation is a good candidate to explain the observed disc lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Giovanni Picogna</name></author><category term="research paper" /><category term="photoevaporation" /><category term="stellar mass" /><summary type="html">The strong X-ray irradiation from young solar-type stars may play a crucial role in the thermodynamics and chemistry of circumstellar discs, driving their evolution in the last stages of disc dispersal as well as shaping the atmospheres of newborn planets.
